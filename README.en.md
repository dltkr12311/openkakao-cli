[한국어](README.md) | **English**

> [!TIP]
> **Works fully without logging in.** `local-send`/`ax-read` drive the real KakaoTalk UI directly via the macOS Accessibility API — no server session needed for either sending real messages or reading recent chat history. Just KakaoTalk running and already logged in — see [Quick Start](#quick-start) below.

> [!NOTE]
> Server login (`login --save`/`login --manual`) is broken on most recent KakaoTalk macOS builds ([#15](https://github.com/JungHoonGhae/openkakao-cli/issues/15), [#20](https://github.com/JungHoonGhae/openkakao-cli/issues/20), [#22](https://github.com/JungHoonGhae/openkakao-cli/issues/22)). **Do NOT repeatedly retry login from an unregistered device** — Kakao may block your account's "sub-device login" or restrict the account (this has actually been reported). The local SQLCipher DB path (`local-chats`/`local-read`/`local-search`) is also currently unreliable on recent builds — use `ax-read` for reads, and `notif-watch` (notification stream, window-independent, self-sends excluded) or `ax-watch` for receive detection.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is an unofficial CLI and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Kakao Corp. It is built for research, automation, and local workflows around the macOS KakaoTalk app.
> Depending on how you use it, Kakao may interpret that use as a violation of its Terms of Service or operating policies, and your account may be suspended or permanently deleted.
> Review the relevant policies yourself before using it and proceed only if you accept full responsibility for that risk.

## Quick Start

### Login-free path (recommended)

No server login needed — just KakaoTalk running and already logged in.

```bash
# Homebrew
brew tap JungHoonGhae/openkakao
brew install openkakao-cli

# 1. Allowlist the chat before any real send (required — guards against sending to the wrong chat)
#    ~/.config/openkakao/config.toml
#    [safety]
#    allow_ax_send = true
#    allowed_send_chats = ["the exact display name shown in your chat list"]

# 2. Send a message — no server contact, drives the real KakaoTalk UI directly
openkakao-cli local-send "chat display name" "Hello from CLI!" --dry-run   # preview
openkakao-cli local-send "chat display name" "Hello from CLI!" -y         # actually send

# 3. Read recent messages — same AX approach, scrapes what's rendered on screen
openkakao-cli ax-read "chat display name" -n 20

# 4. Detect incoming messages (AX) — polls the chat list and fires a hook/webhook
#    when a chat's unread count rises (no server contact)
openkakao-cli ax-watch --hook-cmd 'my-script.sh'

# 5. Detect incoming messages (notification stream) — polls the macOS Notification
#    Center DB for new messages. Works with the KakaoTalk window closed, and your
#    own sent messages are excluded (no login, no server contact)
openkakao-cli notif-watch --json
openkakao-cli notif-watch --hook-keyword 'urgent' --hook-cmd 'my-script.sh'
# Also process messages that arrived while the watcher was down and remain in Notification Center
openkakao-cli notif-watch --replay-existing --json
# Recommended for long-running jobs: persist before delivery and retry after restart
openkakao-cli notif-watch --durable --json
```

Experimental read mode (`--existing-window-only`): manually open the target chat window first, then hide KakaoTalk with Cmd-H and try `openkakao-cli ax-read "chat display name" -n 5 --existing-window-only --json`. This mode does not select a main-list row or open a chat; it reads only messages currently rendered in one already-open window with an exact title match. Duplicate open titles are rejected. **macOS may not expose the window or message tree to AX while the app is hidden**, so Cmd-H support is not guaranteed. It never restores a minimized/off-Space window or steals focus; inaccessible windows produce an error. The normal `ax-read` and all send behavior remain unchanged.

**CLI read and send after using the yellow minimize button (experimental):** run `openkakao-cli ax-read "chat display name" -n 5 --temporarily-restore --json` or `openkakao-cli local-send "chat display name" "message" --temporarily-restore`. KakaoTalk must remain running and logged in, and your terminal needs Accessibility permission. This option uses AX to restore minimized main/chat windows only during the command, then attempts to re-minimize windows that were minimized beforehand and any chat opened by the command. **KakaoTalk may briefly appear or gain focus.** Failure to restore or find an AX window is an error; Cmd-H and other Spaces are not guaranteed. Sending retains the existing chat allowlist, confirmation, and macOS device-owner authentication. If delivery is uncertain, inspect KakaoTalk before retrying to avoid duplicates.

> [!TIP]
> **`ax-watch` vs `notif-watch`** — both detect incoming messages without login. `notif-watch` reads the macOS Notification Center DB (a plaintext SQLite), so it **works even when the KakaoTalk window is closed, minimized, or on another Space**, and since notifications only fire for received messages it **excludes your own sends automatically**. Existing notifications only establish a baseline by default; pass `--replay-existing` to process retained notifications that arrived while the watcher was down. For long-running jobs, prefer `--durable`: it persists events to `~/.config/openkakao/receive_inbox.db`, atomically leases each event to one worker, and retries failures with exponential backoff. After eight failures an event is quarantined so later events can proceed; terminal records missing from Notification Center are pruned after a 24-hour grace period. Delivery is **at least once** (use `chat_id` + `log_id` as the downstream idempotency key). The trade-off: **muted / notifications-off chats** and the **chat you're currently focused on** post no notification, so they aren't seen, and messages already removed from Notification Center cannot be replayed. Run `ax-watch` alongside it if you need those chats with the window open. Events are NDJSON with `event_type`, `chat_name`, `chat_id` (room id), `log_id` (message id), `message`, `attachment`, `received_at`.

### Server-login path (mostly broken right now)

```bash
# 1. Save auth data — fails on most recent builds (#15, #20, #22)
openkakao-cli login --manual --save
#    (older builds where cache extraction still works: openkakao-cli login --save)

# 2. List chats
openkakao-cli chats

# 3. Read messages
openkakao-cli read <chat_id> -n 20

# 4. Read from local DB (unreliable on current builds — see ax-read above)
openkakao-cli local-chats
openkakao-cli local-read <chat_id>

# 5. Send a message (requires allow_loco_write = true in config)
openkakao-cli send <chat_id> "Hello from CLI!"
```

Only force the older cache-backed path when you need it:

```bash
openkakao-cli chats --rest
openkakao-cli read <chat_id> --rest
openkakao-cli members <chat_id> --rest
```

### For Agent

```bash
# Login-free read (no server contact, AX-based)
openkakao-cli ax-read "chat display name" -n 20 --json

# Agents persist a proposal; this never sends
openkakao-cli --no-prefix safe-send propose "chat display name" "message" \
  --reply-chat-id 42 --reply-log-id 99 \
  --idempotency-key 'reply:42:99:policy-v1' --json
openkakao-cli safe-send list --json

# Structured output
openkakao-cli --json chats
openkakao-cli --json read <chat_id> -n 20

# Preview before executing
openkakao-cli send <chat_id> "message" --dry-run --json

# Real-time event stream
openkakao-cli watch --json

# Connect to local hooks or webhooks
openkakao-cli --unattended --allow-watch-side-effects watch \
  --hook-cmd 'jq . > /tmp/openkakao-event.json'
```

To use it directly from Claude Code:

```bash
npx skills add JungHoonGhae/skills@openkakao-cli
```

## Highlights

- Send and read real messages **without logging in**, via `local-send`/`ax-read` (drives the KakaoTalk UI directly through the macOS Accessibility API, no server contact)
- Extracts auth data from the macOS KakaoTalk app
- Reads chats, messages, members, friends, and profiles
- Sends messages, watches real-time events, and handles media over LOCO
- Fits well into `jq`, `cron`, SQLite, and LLM workflows through `--json`
- Connects to local automation and agent flows through `watch`, hooks, and webhooks
- Can recover some reads with `friends --local`, `profile --local`, and `profile --chat-id`
- Local DB reads via `local-chats`, `local-read`, `local-search` (unreliable on current builds — prefer `ax-read`)
- Preview any write with `--dry-run` before executing
- Send to memo chat with `send --me` for quick testing
- LOCO write ops disabled by default — opt in with `safety.allow_loco_write = true`
- `local-send` also disabled by default — opt in with `safety.allow_ax_send = true` plus a `safety.allowed_send_chats` allowlist
- Prefer `safe-send` for agent-driven sends — proposals only touch a local outbox and actual approval requires both a human at an interactive terminal and macOS Touch ID/login-password authentication

## Where It Fits

- when you want chat history as JSON for downstream tools
- when KakaoTalk should become an input channel for local scripts or operator tools
- when you want to trigger follow-up actions from watch events through hooks or webhooks
- when you want one CLI that works for both direct terminal use and AI-driven local workflows

## Safety Mode

Since v1.1.0, LOCO write operations (send, delete, edit, react) are **disabled by default**.
To protect your account, commands that write to the server require explicit opt-in.

```toml
# ~/.config/openkakao/config.toml
[safety]
allow_loco_write = true
```

`local-send` (AX-based real sending) is also disabled by default as of v1.4.0, and needs its own opt-in plus a **chat allowlist**. There is no chat-id left to cross-check the target against, so a real send combines the allowlist with a unique exact-name match in the chat list, KakaoTalk code-signature verification, and macOS user authentication immediately before sending:

```toml
# ~/.config/openkakao/config.toml
[safety]
allow_ax_send = true
allowed_send_chats = ["your memo chat's display name", "another allowed chat"]
```

For agents and automation, prefer `safe-send` over a direct `local-send -y`:

```bash
# 1. Persist a proposal only — this command can never send
openkakao-cli safe-send propose "chat display name" "message to review"

# 2. Inspect proposed and uncertain intents
openkakao-cli safe-send list

# 3. A human reviews the exact target/message, types the 12-character code,
#    then approves with macOS Touch ID or the login password
openkakao-cli safe-send approve <intent_id>

# Discard an intent
openkakao-cli safe-send cancel <intent_id>
```

Proposals expire after 15 minutes and live in `~/.config/openkakao/safe_send_outbox.db` with `0600` permissions. Approval has no unattended bypass: it requires both the interactive 12-character code and macOS device-owner authentication. A direct real `local-send` requires the same OS authentication. The outbox enforces at least 10 seconds between claims, 3 sends per chat per hour, 10 globally per hour, and 20 globally per day. A failure proven to occur before the final Return key is classified as `not_sent`, so the proposal can be reviewed again; an ambiguous result after Return may have been delivered, or an interrupted execution, becomes `uncertain` and is never retried automatically. The running process must have KakaoTalk's official bundle/team code signature, the chat list must contain one unique exact-name row, and a non-empty composer is refused. The selected row and composer are read back immediately before Return, and completion is verified only when the composer clears and an additional exact-text **outgoing** bubble appears.

This path is implemented directly with macOS Accessibility/CoreGraphics inside `openkakao-cli`. Orca and agent `$computer-use` skills are not installation or runtime dependencies; agents use the domain-level `safe-send propose` plus human approval instead of generic UI click or keyboard actions.

Read-only operations are always available:

| Command | Description | Server Contact |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `ax-read <chat_name>` | Scrape recent messages from an open chat window (AX) | None |
| `ax-watch` | Poll the chat list, fire a hook/webhook when unread count rises (AX, no login) | None |
| `notif-watch` | Poll the macOS Notification Center DB for new incoming messages — window-independent, self-sends excluded (no login) | None |
| `local-chats` | List chats from local DB (unreliable on current builds) | None |
| `local-read <id>` | Read messages from local DB (unreliable on current builds) | None |
| `local-search "keyword"` | Search local DB (unreliable on current builds) | None |
| `chats --rest` | List chats via REST | REST |
| `read <id> --rest` | Read messages via REST | REST |
| `send ... --dry-run` | Preview send without executing | None |
| `local-send ... --dry-run` | Preview an AX send without executing | None |
| `safe-send propose/list` | Persist or inspect send proposals (never sends) | None |

> [!NOTE]
> `local-send`/`ax-read`/`ax-watch` need to find KakaoTalk's **main chat-list window** via the macOS Accessibility API. If that window is **minimized**, or on a different **macOS Space** (virtual desktop) than the one you're currently viewing, it won't be found — restoring it automatically isn't possible without risking a stolen foreground focus, so these commands give a clear error and ask you to restore it by hand instead. If this keeps happening, a one-time fix is: right-click the KakaoTalk Dock icon → Options → Assign To → All Desktops.
>
> **`notif-watch` is not subject to this** — it reads the macOS Notification Center DB rather than an AX window, so it works regardless of window state (but muted / focused chats post no notification and so aren't seen).

- [kakaocli](https://github.com/silver-flight-group/kakaocli) (MIT) — `local-send`'s macOS Accessibility API automation (selecting chat rows, locating/driving the message input field) was ported to Rust from this project (`src/ax_send.rs`).
- [Peekaboo](https://github.com/steipete/Peekaboo) (MIT) — `local-send` posts events directly to the target process via `CGEventPostToPid`, an approach borrowed from Peekaboo, to avoid the foreground-activation timing race that kakaocli's `send` hits ([silver-flight-group/kakaocli#9](https://github.com/silver-flight-group/kakaocli/issues/9)).
